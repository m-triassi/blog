## Massimo Triassi - Web Developer based in Canada

**Hello!** I'm Massimo Triassi, a passionate web developer with a knack for creating innovative and visually stunning digital experiences.
I've been a web developer for nearly a decade, and my expertise spans across various technologies and industries. 

I've primarily worked on the back-end but have never shied away from dancing across the stack whether it be 
front-end development, or handling DevOps and Cloud infrastructure.

I'm a lifelong learner, and I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and skillset.

## Skills and Expertise

My deepest area of knowledge lies in back-end development using PHP and Laravel. I've been using Laravel for the last 8 years,
and have developed a deep understanding of the framework's core concepts, best practices and first party packages.

I'm also an avid home-lab enthusiast, and have a strong background in server administration and networking. I've used this passion
to hone my skills in cloud infrastructure, DevOps, and automation.

Formally, I'm a software engineering graduate with a Bachelor's from [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/) in Montreal. 
There, I specialized in machine learning and artificial intelligence (before it was cool!).
